	<p>A high performance web user interface toolkit based on the 
		spiralcraft.textgen package.
	</p>
	
	<p>Each webui resource (or "page") encapsulates a tree of interconnected 
	  Components and other TextGen elements that comprise the "View-Controller"
	  role in the pattern. These UI elements interface with the model via data
	  Channels implemented by the spiralcraft.lang package and by the Command
	  pattern provided by the spiralcraft.command package.
	</p>

	<h3>State Management</h3>
	
	<p>The WebUI Components as well as the TextGen Elements they are built on
	  explicitly separate "state" from "infrastructure". Components manipulate
	  their state at specific predetermined points in the service process. 
	</p>
	   
	<p>The separation of "state" from "infrastructure" adds design complexity
	  when compared to a model where Components encapsulate their own state,
	  for example- a TextControl storing the text it contains. This separation
	  is necessary to avoid serious functional and performance related 
	  limitations of the latter simplified model by solving two basic problems
	  with one mechanism.
	</p>
	  
	<p>To efficiently support a large number of simultaneous users, the
	  conservation of per-session memory consumption is a primary design goal.
	  Controls are normally associated with application model bindings and 
	  configuration metadata. While the state of the control (data contents,
	  selection position, paging state, etc) will be tracked for each user, the
	  Control object itself and its associated infrastructure will only be
	  instantiated once per "declaration", per Servlet context. This reduces
	  per-user memory consumption to a fraction of the amount that would be
	  taken up by instantiating the entire UI infrastructure in each WebUI
	  resource for each concurrent user.
	</p>
	
	<p>To efficiently represent grids, lists, detail panes, and other UI elements
	  that involve the repeated display of identical controls for a varying
	  amount of data, "state", which varies with the number of items or rows
	  presented, must be separated from infrastructure, which ideally does not
	  change after it is initially loaded or reprogrammed. In these cases, a 
	  single instance of a Control will render or process a set of states
	  associated with a multiple-element data structure from the model. A
	  "state-tree" will be formed as a result of the one-to-many relationship
	  associated with UI Components of this sort.
	</p>
	
	<p>To summarize, the use of stateless Controls as "infrastructure" in
	  conjuction with "state trees" that maintain associations with user 
	  sessions and session specific data instances provides the means to
	  efficiently represent data-driven multi-element UI components as well
	  as to efficiently implement multi-session user interfaces.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Sequence</h3>
	
	<h4>Request Processing</h4>
	
	<ul>
	   <li>UIServlet: Finds the UIComponent associated with the requested
	     resource URI, or creates it by compiling the resource and instantiating
	     one.
	   </li>
	   
     <li>UIServlet: Resolves the Session-scoped state of the UIComponent or
       creates a clean state for the UIComponent. 
     </li>
     
     <li>UIServlet: Prepares a ServiceContext that exposes state and output
       methods to Components.
     </li>
     
     <li>If a new Session-scoped state is created for this request, the
       "initialize" message is sent to all components.
     </li>
     
     <li>Any actions are handled by sending ActionMessages to the components
       that added them. This may result in other messages and behavior,
       including the processing of form data, etc.
     </li>
     
     <li>All one-time actions are cleared
     </li>
     
     <li>A RequestMessage is sent to all components to allow them to prepare
       for rendering
     </li>
     
     <li>HTTP Request headers are set up
     </li>
     
     <li>The Component is rendered
     </li>
     
     <li>The new UIComponent state is preserved in the session.
     </li>
	</ul>
